Pokemon: The First Movie Original Plot

Dr. Fuji speaks of being sent on an expedition that was funded by Giovanni.
The journal entry, dated the 6th of August, states that the purpose of the journey was to look for Mew, supposedly the strongest Pokémon known to mankind.
The reasons for the expedition are for Fuji to obtain a sample of Mew DNA, which he could use in an attempt to clone the creature, a project which Giovanni will fund.
However, Fuji's true motives for agreeing to the project are more personal, as he wishes to use the research to recreate his deceased daughter, Amber.
The team managed to acquire what they believe to be a Mew fossil, which Fuji hopes is authentic, as he would have the genetic material he requires to create Giovanni's super-Pokémon.
The scientific team begins work on the cloning process, and after a period of time, Mewtwo is born.
The scientists observe the immature Mewtwo floating in its tank and lament that despite its strong vital signs, it has not gained consciousness, much like the other clones.
However, Mewtwo can hear their voices, though he does not understand what they are saying.
Through the usage of telepathy, the clone of Amber, Ambertwo, tells Mewtwo that they are speaking.
Mewtwo is startled and wonders what Ambertwo is and she replies that she is "a girl, a person."
She tells Mewtwo that she was not aware that Pokémon could communicate like humans, to which Mewtwo ponders if he is a Pokémon or a human; however, Ambertwo says it should never matter which one it is.

The scientific team study the clones' brainwave patterns and figure out that they are speaking to each other through the usage of telepathy.
Fuji, however, is indifferent to the announcement, as he is concerned with the clone of his daughter.
Ambertwo explains to Mewtwo that she and all the others are clones, hence the "-two" suffix in their names.
She explains that the scientists call her "Ambertwo," but she is still Amber inside.

Fuji, observing the clones, hopes that his daughter will be able to live once more.
He thinks back to before he had begun the Mewtwo project, to when he was attempting to clone Amber in the basement of his home.
His wife, however, was distraught over the loss of their daughter and became angry with his endeavors, telling him that he could not bring Amber back. She eventually left him, telling him that she loved their daughter as much as he did, but he needed to accept the fact that she was gone, and she could not continue to watch him continue his fruitless efforts.
Later, Fuji and a scientist discuss the status of the clones, and how Giovanni will be happy to soon have the strongest Pokémon of all. Fuji, however, hopes that their efforts will grant him with the knowledge to finally be able to create a viable clone of Amber.
Ambertwo shows Mewtwo and the rest of the clones—Charmandertwo, Squirtletwo and Bulbasaurtwo, clones of Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur respectively—a memory where she used to live and shows him elements of life, wind, sun, rain and times of the day. Mewtwo asks Ambertwo if the Moon is the Sun and is told the moon is there to keep people from being afraid of the dark. Soon, the clones slowly fade away, which the scientists lament as "another failure." Inside Ambertwo's "Remember Place," Mewtwo looks around for the other clones and asks Ambertwo where they had gone. However, Ambertwo begins to fade away, which one of the scientists notes quietly. Fuji watches solemnly as the energy pulse in the tank fades away.
Mewtwo, worried, asks Ambertwo what is happening, to which she replies that, "it feels like it's time to say goodbye." Mewtwo begins to cry at the loss of his friend, and Ambertwo assures him that it will be alright and thanks him for caring about her. She tells him he will live and that life is wonderful. However, Mewtwo calls out for Ambertwo in sadness and fear, which begins to manifest as a psychic emission and spike in brain activity. As alarm klaxons blare, Fuji orders his assistant to stabilize Mewtwo's powers by administering a memory-wiping serum. The serum almost fails to take effect, but gradually, Mewtwo calms down and falls asleep. The team is relieved and while Dr. Fuji is glad Mewtwo survived, he is outraged that his daughter is gone forever.
Mewtwo slowly matures, and in its sleep, it states that it feels like it has been asleep for what seems like forever. It still has slight memories of Amber, and ponders over her last words.
Mewtwo Strikes Back continues from this point.
