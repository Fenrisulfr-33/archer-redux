## Getting Started with Next, TailwindCSS and MDX

1. Create your create your Next.js base.

```
$  npx create-next-app my-project
```

```
$  cd my-project
```

2. Install the tailwindCss package
   - The `init -p` is the file needed for settings up your custom class or overwriting current ones

```js
$   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$   npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. [Optional] If you are writing a blog site I highly recommened using this.
   - Link: [TailwindCSS Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

```js
$   npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

4. In your newly created **tailwind.config.js** file add the jit (Just in time) engine. Make sure the
   the .js, .ts, .jsx, and .tsx files are being hit by tailwindcss. The screens is not neccessary
   and you can remove them, I personally like my site to be very reactive to certain size screens.

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  purge: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", \
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  darkMode: true, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    screens: {
      phone: "480px",
      tablet: "768px",
      laptop: "1024px",
      desktop: "1200px",
      wide: "1280px",
      ultrawide: "1536px",
    },
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};
```

5. Inside your globals.css add the following.

```js
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

6. [Optional] If you want to add styles or classes to your entire webpade, you can do so like this.
   The reason we add `@layer` is because these need to come before the utilites or else we wouldn't be able to
   add custom classes and tailwinds default classes. This allows you to sneak a couple of classes right in the the
   className not including your custom class. - Link: [TailwindCSS @apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrftauE2Vyk).

```js
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .h1 {
    @apply
    bg-purple-600
    leading-tight
    rounded-lg
    p-2
    text-left
    text-gray-300
    font-extrabold
    text-[min(4vw,100px)]
  }
}
```

7. Have fun and play around!

```js
$ npm run dev
```
