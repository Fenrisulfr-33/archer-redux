# Pokemon

Welcome to my baby, this is the Pokemon section of the site.
This section will eventually be a one-stop shop for Pokemon fans, but for now, I am working with the best I have.

## National Dex

The national dex has all 1010 pokemon, right now.
I am working on having forms in the Pokemon-specific page as well in the National Dex table for easy access.
And will be getting a guidebook and looking at data for Scarlet and Violet post-launch.
From the national dex, you can search by type and dual-type. 
By clicking a Pokemon you will be redirected to their respective page.
There is also a sorting by stats coming very soon.

## Pokemon Specific page

Pokemon-specific page data is set to Scarlet & Violet so if there are no moves for that Pokemon it is because they are not in the game.
However, I am working on a dropdown to allow you to select which game you want to view as all the move data is already in my database.
IF A POKEMON CAN/CANNOT USE MOVES NOT LISTED IN THE MOVE AREA LIST EMAIL ME HERE at GengarsHauntedMansion@proton.me and 
I will check my data accordingly in order to fix it in an timely manner.
