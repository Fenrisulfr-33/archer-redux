# Breeding in Scarlet and Violet

---

## The Basics

    In order to understand breeding you have to understand the basics of pokemon natures/evs/ivs

### What is a pokemon nature

    
    Every pokemon has a nature, natures give a 10% boost in one stat, and a 10% decrease in another stat.
    The stats a pokemon are Health, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.
    There are a total of 25 natures, 5 of which do not do anything because they boost and decrease the same stat.
    Health CANNOT be modified by natures.
