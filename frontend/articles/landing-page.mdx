# Welcome to the Haunted Mansion

Welcome all to the spooky mansion you are about to enter!
I wish to provide you with information on Pokemon & Pokemon-related topics. 
This site means to give you all an easier and aesthetically pleasing time viewing
and creating Pokemon data. But that's not all, I aim to create more tabs that can provide
various sources of information on things like Tem-Tem, Diablo 4, coding snippets, software engineering
information  and the frameworks I used to make this website happen.

## The Haunted Mansion Currently

This project is completely independent and run solo by me. 
If you are intrested in providing feedback or joining the team in helping out you can reach me at
GengarsHauntedMansion@proton.me with any complaints or requests. 
I encourgae all forms of critisim as this is meant to help people struggling using other pokemon 
websites to view, create, and maintain Pokemon data. I have a TemTem dex and Tem page currently in
 the works for anyone who also likes Pokemon related games.

## Reasons for creating this site

As a Pokemon fan, and expert breeder I found it troubling to gather information on where to obtain certain
pokemon, how to get their Hidden Abilities, Items, TMs, Egg Moves, breeding information and gameplay 
stradegies for optimized playing time. I used to have 3-4 sites open at once trying to make sure the data 
was accuracte and I wasn't wasting my time or everything was correct. And sometimes you would need multiple 
sites to get said information. Here are a few examples of what I mean.
    
Where [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/ "Best site for pokemon information") lacks is competitive builds
and easy access to ability or move descriptions, you are redirected to a new page when clicking on a move.
Even if you want to check a pokemons different moves from another generation you are redirected again and 
lose the basic info of the pokemon.

[Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex/ "Great historic pokemon site") has terrible Navigation, 
I do not care what you say I have been using the site for 5 years and they need a page that just explains
where everything is. I find myself looking at the top navigation page and thinking I can go up a level
to get to more tabs and instead find myself lost and cannot get back to where I was. For a site as old
as they are they need to update their nav, I love them to death but cannot stay with the old times.

[Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/ "The site for Pokemon Comp Builds") is the goto site for
making competivite Pokemon builds, teams, and printing out team sheets. However I wish they had a section
that just let you save pages of builds instead of teams. I always find myself wanting to save breeding
builds for regulat playthroughs and needing to use google sheets or excel. I aim to make user login and
a page where you can do just that, and even save by game and provide team anaylitics for team builds.

I had a paragraph explaing what was wrong with [tem.team](https://tem.team/ "Current best site for Temtem") for
awhile now however, at the time or writing this they have fixed everything I had complained about. 
As of right now the site is amazing and I'm happy how far they have come. Do not use TemTem Wiki page,
it's terrible and after an update they moved all their code somewhere else and it still feels clunky 
and the CSS is all over the place.

Complaining about websites doesn't do anybody any good especially if a site has existed for X amount of
years and clearly is not going to rebrand or update to a modern UI. So I took my frustration by starting
my own. But nothing I say matters unless I build a better site.

## Pokemon Data

Pokemon data for engineering is all over the place, because their is no offical free Pokemon API we are
stuck to using the free [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ "Free Pokemon Data API) API for now. There data 
is very large for just an indivdual Pokemon, and where they have seperate routes for smaller data it 
feels like it would have been easier to include it in the main .json. I am not perfect but there are 
alot of flaws and repetition with the data model which I aim to improve. At the time of writing this 
I build my own Pokemon API and backend server that fits the need of my website. I am still working out
some kinks with some data as it is not all accurate and has taking me alot of time to get where I am 
now. In the future I will provide access to this backend server for everyone to use once I feel its
ready for open access.
