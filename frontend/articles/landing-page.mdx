# Welcome to the Haunted Mansion

Welcome all to the spooky mansion you are about to enter!
I wish to provide you with information on Pokemon & Pokemon-related topics. 
This site means to give you all an easier and aesthetically pleasing time viewing
and creating Pokemon data. But that's not all, I aim to create more tabs that can provide
various sources of information on things like Tem-Tem, Diablo 4, coding snippets, software engineering
information  and the frameworks I used to make this website happen.

## The Haunted Mansion Currently

This project is completely independent and run solo by me. 
If you are intrested in providing feedback or joining the team in helping out you can reach me at
GengarsHauntedMansion@proton.me with any complaints or requests. 
I encourgae all forms of critisim as this is meant to help people struggling using other pokemon 
websites to view, create, and maintain Pokemon data. I have a TemTem dex and Tem page currently in
 the works for anyone who also likes Pokemon related games.
