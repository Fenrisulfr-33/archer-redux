## Overview

    The purpose of this site is to provide information for anyone intrested in any of the following
    tabs or sub tabs as shown in the Navigation bar. Most of the information is somewhat bias, meaning
    everything is put together by me and sorta for me. While I plan on implementing new features like user login
    and team builds with stats and pdf downloads, alot of this stuff takes time and money. If you like this
    page you can email me ideas for new tabs and information or just to add to the current pages at *Insert Email Here*.
    Otherwise you can also support me on my patreon, I haven't really thought of any bonus for the pateron page yet
    so I would also like you to email me your recommendation on what you would pay money for monthly to support me.

## Features currently in the works and reasoning

### Pokemon page moduals

    Having moduals for almsot all realtive infromation on a page.
    This is important to me because alot of information on Pokemon or TemTem has alot of redirection to another page for something that could just be a pop up.
    Once implemented I believe this feature along with team building will seperate my site from others.
    I do not want to take away from sites like [tem.team](https://tem.team/ "Current best site for Temtem"), [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex/ "Great historic pokemon site"), [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/ "The site for Pokemon Comp Builds"), and [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/ "Best site for pokemon information").
    
    The problem is that you need each site to get all the information.
    
    Where pokemonDB lacks is competitive builds and easy access to ability or move descriptions, you are redirected to an entire new page.
    Even if you want to check a pokemons different moves from another generation you are redirected and lose the basic info of the pokemon.
    
    Serebii has terrible Navigation, I do not care what you say I have been using the site for years and they almost need a page that just explains where everything is.
    For a site that old they need to update their nav, I love them to death but cannot stay with the old times. 
    And if your argument is well get better at navigating it, you have already proven my point, a website shouldn't take skill to use it should just work for newcomers.

    tem.team is a great site overall, except they do not have any comp builds out at the time I am writing this.
    I get the Asbury update just came out and the meta changed, but you should be leaving old builds up, and they also should redirect you to a new page.
    Every build is small enough to glance at and then have a button like, `add to my team` or `save build for late` or `update build`.
    I do not want to take away from their site though there awesome.
    TemTem Wiki sucks though, same thing, the naviation is werid as in...
    They have a types dropdown page but not quick access to a type weakness chart unless you search for it, I mean as a current user I want to go on your site and just get the chart.
    But the Wiki is generic for alot of info so I get it isnt like a pokemonDB kinda site.
    
    I really shouldn't need the search bar for anything.
    You will always have basic page searching but for some reason these sites always use a sorta in house google and comes up with multiple sites.
    EG: in pokemon DB if you type in Gengar and hit enter it searches a bunch of sites and returns there gengar page at the top.
    But if I click on the Gengar name in the search window it takes me directly to that page.
    Maybe I am the only person finding that sorta stuff annoying.
    You could also have a basic menu of buttons on any of these sites no matter the page that had moduals for type weakness, pokeballs, temtem location, etc...
    Even if it was at the bottom its still there so I have quick access when trying to make a build and have reasoning behind it without leaving the page.

    Am I bitching yes, because if you are happy with what you built then you'll never strive to make it better.
    But nothing I say matters unless I build a better site.

### TemTem

    Temtem is currently working on producing an API that so creators can create up-to-date sites. 
    While thats awesome and I will use it to extract info, I will eventually build my own because I enjoy data modeling.
    To which when I complete I will post a link of video on this site showing how I did it and why I did it.

    Update: 20220816 - There is a good TemTem Api out there now created by <insert there name here> <insert link here>.
    I have some beef with the moves object but thats because im picky other then that I think its beautiful.

### Articles page

    Eventually I want to break this apart and have categories and use a CMS but for now this will have to do.

    This page just has a list of articles Im working on as alot of people I know have so many questions about old pokemon games.
    For people who never played sun and moon and even for some people who have, they don't understand SOS chaining and why its one of the fastest ways to level up and EV train.
    I go in depth on how its atcually the fastest other then hacking, and in general I enjoy a good SOS hunt its way better then shiny resetting.
    I could talk about this stuff all day but thats what the articles are for so use them if you are intrested.

### Code page

    While this page is currently in work it will cover how I made alot of this site or ideas I get closer to in the future.
    The repo for this site will most likely be private, I am not trying to monotize this site but I worked really hard on this and maybe in the future if I gain support for help with new issues I will open it up.

    If there are any specific things you want to know how I did email me at <insert email here> and I will see what I can do.
    I am pretty open to anything.

    For refrence the origin version of this site has Next.js, React, Tailwindcss, Mongoose and MondoDB.
    The updated version includes all the above and Typescript with Redux.

    Adding Redux with Nextjs was challenging so I just started from scratch and once I got it implement I started refactoring and brining everything over.
