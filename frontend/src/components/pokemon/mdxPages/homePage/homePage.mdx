## Pokemon

    Welcome to my baby, this is the Pokemon section of the site.
    This section will eventually be a one stop shop for pokemon fans, but for now I am working with the best I have.

### National Dex

    The national dex has all 898 pokemon, right now. 
    Soon will add the other new Legends Arceus pokemon.
    And will be getting a guide book and looking at data for Scarlet and Violet pre launch.
    From the national dex you can search by name or type, by clicking a pokemon you will be redirected to there respective page.

### Pokemon specific page

    Specififc pokemon page has the current game for Competitive, so Sword and Shield.
    However you can scroll through other games to see movesets, but in Sword and Shield Comp builds you are using the moves from that game.
    IF A POKEMON CAN USE MOVES NOT LISTED IN THE SWORD AND SHIELD LIST EMAIL ME HERE **insert_email** AND I WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT MOVES ARE BANDED IN SWORD AND SHIELD.
