# Search for Pokemon by Moveset

This moveset search is only compatible with scarlet and violet pokemon at the moment.
Eventually there will be a game drop down which will change what moves you can search for and what pokemon in those games can learn that move.
The reason for this is because even if a pokemon can learn a move in a different game they might not be able to use it in the current format making it an illegal move.
If a pokemon is not coming up that you know learns a move please contact me @email here.
