# Destiny 2 Overall Weapon perks & mags breakdown

## Overview

Destiny 2 players have a tendency to say, Oh I got the god roll insert_gun_here, it has dog_shit_perk and  another_dog_shit_perk_that_doesnt_work_with_the_first_perk.
To witch I will always reply with, 'Well what barrel, mag perk, and masterwork do u have?'
And they'll say, 'Oh that doesn't really matter.'
Wrong.
Guns mags are arguebly just as important as your column perks, and some masterworks can be completely useless.
If a gun has 90 handling, that extra 10 isn't really doing anything, but that 30-40 range bump might make those hitting enemies feel that much better.

Note: How you play the game and what weapons and perk you main the most determine what is your god roll.
This is mearly advice to help you the player bettew understand why this perks are so vastly different and why there just as important as the column perks.

So lets break it down.

There are guns the greatly improved when having the right barrels, magazines, and masterwork.
Some guns are only good with the right barrel, mag perks, because no two combination of column perks can make a gun with 10 recoil feel like 100.
And even if your perks are good they wont help ur bullet magnetism and cone diameter land your shots. 
Some perks can decrease cone diameter and shot grouping but they only really excel with good stats, they wont make up for it alone.
I cannot go over all guns but I will slowly work my way to all archtypes of guns.
So for starters I am going to go over my favoritve weapon I've been chasing a 5/5 for for awhile and still don't have.

### The Unforgiven.
The unforgiven is a 750rpm void smg that is heavily contrasted to the funnelweb a 900rpm void smg.
This smg can either be great, or god tier if everything aligns perfectly.
For barrels there are two barrels that everyone in the community talk about and thats arrowhead break, and fluted barrel.
I will discuss some other good ones, but I want to clairfy why these two barrels are vastly different and one is not better then the other.

### Barrel perks

#### Arrowhead break
Arrowhead break grants 30 recoil and 10 handling.
You do not need arrowhead break with this weapon, because, it has 93 recoil direction, 7 recoil will not benefit this weapon what so ever.
While arrowhead break is a top 3 barrel perk it doesn't belong here.
Arrowhead break is for guns that already have 70 or less recoil direction, you could easily equip a counterbalance mod if the gun is at 70-80 and you dont wanna use arrowhead break.
In that case you could use fluted for extra handling and still acheieve 100 recoil.

#### Hammer-Forge Rifling
Hammer-forge Rifling is good for things that don't have much range but have great stability and handling already, something like rufus fury benefits from some more range because it already has such little recoil.
Alot of people think more range === more damage, however it just increases the damage falloff at which your highest damage can be obtained.
I would also argue if you think a gun lacks alot of range and you need alot of range increases maybe you should be using a different weapon/weapone archtype all together.
Range is also tied to zoom of a weapon, so even though the base stat for Mykel's Reverance is 33 and the Drang's is 35, Mykel's has a zoom of 12, and drang has a zoom of 13 which is a bigger multipler so you'll notice your shots landing from farther with drang then Mykel's.

#### Fluted barrel
Fluted barrel grants 5 stability and 15 handling, this is more for guns where u don't need recoil direction.
FLuted is also a top 3 barrel perk.
Fluted barrel is good for alot of pulse rifles because of the burst of a pulse helps control the grouping of the burst.
It creates a more vertical pattern that can be partned well with perks like headseeker and keep away.

#### Corkscrew rifling
Corkscrew rifling add 5 stability, 5 range, and 5 handling.
Corkscrew rifling is the go to perk for this weapon, and I would aruge is the best for all smgs.
Because the recoil direction for this is so good for this weapon we want more corckscrew, its makes the gun overall feel like it has a tighter grouping.

### Mag perks

Note: If your a player who priorities more bullets this is not your weapon, all mag perks only give like ~3 bullets extra and we you can achive that with backup mag.
The max you could hold is 34 with backup mag and extended mag, but it kills your realod speed and this gun already suffer from reload speed.

#### Ricochet Rounds
These in my opionon are the best in the game for most guns, pve. In Pvp, High Cal. rounds cause more flinch for your enemey.
Ricochet rounds grant 5 range and 10 stability.
They also bound off surfaces and can hit multiple targets.

### First column perk

Note: When it comes to god rolls everything depends on your style of play, if your someone who loves melee builds, theres gun perk to help you. 
If your somone who like grenade builds, theres perks for you.
But at the end of the day there is no one god roll if a gun has multiple good perks in both columns.
But hopefully I can clear some stuff up.

#### Demolitionist
Demolitionist is primarly for people with grenade builds, and for this gun is the single best first column perk for this gun.
Some may argue feeding frenzy as this is an ad clear weapon, but feeding frenzy has been nerfed hard from what it use to be so its no longer S tier.
Demolitionlist grants grenade energy back on kill, and can reload the entire mag when you throw a grenade, a must have for void grenade buils.

### Second column perk

Note: After alot of testing I always wanted to grind for a demo frenzy unforgiven, and I realized how dumb I was.

#### Adrenaline Junkie
This perk combo together isn't just S tier, but is hands down the best option.
In comparsion to frenzy, frenzy takes some time proc. and after damage testing would do ~3,400 a shot to a regular enemy.
Adrenaline junkie can be maxed out at x5 with one grenade kill or five kills with the weapon itself.
Adrenaline junkie x5 will hit for ~4000 a shot, turning this thing into a absolute monster.

### Masterwork

Note: Because we have so many other good barrels and mag perks I intiality would say its either between range or handling but...

#### Range
Range makes this thing just a tad bit better for ad clear at distant and because our stats are so high with this archtype of gun, handling would be a second best but not neccesary.

### Mod

#### Backup Mag
This only takes the mag to 31 but having the extra bullets is nice
You could also run minor spec, taken spec, or major spec depending on the activity your doing and itll just add more damage overall to the type of enemy.

### Intrinct perk

#### Bitterspite
This perk overall isnt the best, it adds reload speed for taking damage on a 5 tier system, max being 90% of the orginal reload but overall feels underwhelming.
This gun would be overpowered if this was reduce to anything around below 70%.
Hopefully they mess with it in the future because as it stands it barely helps the feel of this gun.
